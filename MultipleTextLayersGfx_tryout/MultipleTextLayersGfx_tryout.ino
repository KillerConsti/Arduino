/*
  This example shows how multiple scrolling text layers can be used
  This example requires the Adafruit_GFX Library, which you can install through Arduino Library Manager
  The "GFX" Layers in SmartMatrix Library 4.0 depend on Adafruit_GFX and give access to using large fonts included
    with Adafruit_GFX, and the ability to add custom fonts
  Performance of the "GFX" layers has been optimized, and with the Teensy 4, you can have 10 scrolling text layers
    on a 128x64 panel, and still refresh the panel at 240Hz
  Optionally draw a pattern behind the text layers using FastLED (same code as the FastLED_Functions example) by
    removing the comments from `#define INCLUDE_FASTLED_BACKGROUND` below.  With the Teensy 4 you'll still see 
    128x64 @ 240Hz Refresh even with the pattern updating at 60 FPS!
